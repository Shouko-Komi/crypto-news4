            <p>Eric Trump has once again caught the crypto community’s attention, this time with a bullish call on Bitcoin. However, unlike his Ethereum prediction, which aligned with a dramatic price reversal, Bitcoin's reaction has been much more subdued.</p>
            
            <h2>Eric Trump’s Market Influence</h2>
            <p>On February 6, Eric Trump posted on X, stating, “Feels like a great time to enter #BTC!” The post initially pushed Bitcoin past $98,000 before the price settled at around $97,650, reflecting only a modest 0.4% hourly gain.</p>
            
            <p>This response differs significantly from the Ethereum market movement following his February 1st tweet. After a major sell-off triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, Ethereum plummeted by 37% but rebounded over 35% within 18 hours of Eric Trump’s tweet.</p>
            
            <h2>Bitcoin’s Current Market Dynamics</h2>
            <p>Unlike Ethereum, which was oversold before its recovery, Bitcoin has been trading near record highs. The cryptocurrency has experienced steady gains in recent months, making a sudden reversal less likely.</p>
            
            <h2>Will Bitcoin Follow Ethereum’s Path?</h2>
            <p>Traders are closely monitoring whether Trump’s call will have a lasting impact on Bitcoin’s trajectory. While his Ethereum tweet coincided with a pivotal market moment, Bitcoin’s high price levels suggest a different trading environment.</p>
            
            <p>Whether this tweet marks a meaningful shift remains to be seen, but it underscores the growing intersection of politics, media, and cryptocurrency markets.</p>
